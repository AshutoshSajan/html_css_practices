				<div class="box2">
					<p class="p">Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organised. I've used a reset to ensure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.

				<div class="box3">
					<p class="p">These two are positioned using <span>Float:left;</span></p>
				</div>
				<div class="box4">
					<p class="p">
						You can see that, evev though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...

						What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%,right?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box6">
					<p class="p">
						Wrong! Because,together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.

				<div class="box8">
					<p class="p">
						The two elpadding-top: 10px;ements are side-by-side just as i intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which,in the case, is the same as the width of the viewport.)
