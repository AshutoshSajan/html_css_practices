				<h1>Side-By-Side Positioning Demo<h1>

				<section class="sec1">
					<div class=" box box1 toprow"> 
						<p class="p">these two divs are positioned next to one another using <span>display: inline-block</span>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box box2 toprow rightbox">
						<p class="p">Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organised. I've used a reset to ensure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.

	<!-- section two -->

				<section class="sec2">
					<div class=" box box3 secrow">
						<p class="p">These two are positioned using <span>Float:left;</span></p>
					</div>
					<div class="box box4 secrow rightbox">
						<p class="p">
							You can see that, evev though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...

		<!-- section three -->

				<section class="sec3">
					<div class=" box box5 thirdrow">
						<p class="p">
							What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%,right?
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class=" five box6 thirdrow">
						<p class="p">
							Wrong! Because,together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.

					<div class="box box7 bottomrow">

							If i do the same thing with floated elements...

					</div><!-- 
				--><div class=" box box8 bottomrow rightbox">
					<p class="p">
						The two elpadding-top: 10px;ements are side-by-side just as i intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which,in the case, is the same as the width of the viewport.)
